This is a direct copy of the default theme from Vanilla into a spot appropriate for Laravel.

To change the theme, follow these modified Vanilla instructions:

Part 1: CSS / Design
====================
If you like the layout and want to change only the look and feel of the forums, you can add your custom styles to `design/custom.css`.

If you want to edit the look & feel of the administrative screens, also edit `design/customadmin.css`.

If you want to affect non-forum pages, then you will have to edit the Vanilla source code itself.

Part 2: HTML / Views (Advanced)
===============================
If you want to adjust the layout as well, you need to edit the layout files.

To add a banner or menu, change the footer, or any other major layout component, edit the `views/default.master.tpl` file.

To change something specific about a particular part of Vanilla, find the file in `views/*` holding the existing content and change it there.
